# MOVIes Data and Algorithms
A university project written in Java.
It's a movie database in which using different algorithms you can find movies and actors based on title, year of release, a specific actor etc. 
And collaborations between actors using graph algorithms

### Implemented dictionaries and algorithms.
- Dictionaries:
  - Binary Search Tree.
  - B-Tree.
- Sorting Algorithms:
  - Quick Sort.
  - Insertion Sort.
- Graph algorithms:
  - Breadth-first search.
  - Kruskal algorithm.

### How to use:
- Create an instance of MovidaCore.
- Load the formatted data from file (as in **example0.txt** and **example1.txt**) using the method `loadFromFile(File f)`.
